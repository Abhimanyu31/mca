    <h1>Web Security</h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Web security protects networks, servers, and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes defending computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Website protection technology has enabled enhanced protection mechanisms, such as the protection of a virtual private network (VPN), which also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations. Businesses need to account for the factors that go into web security and threat prevention.
