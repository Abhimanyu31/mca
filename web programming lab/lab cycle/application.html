    <h1>Application Server</h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the 
        operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], 
        communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.
