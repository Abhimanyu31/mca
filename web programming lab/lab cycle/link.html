            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer systems that enables communication and the sharing
                 of information across the world. The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and conduct
                  business. Web programming refers to the development of web applications and websites that are accessed over the
                   Internet. Web programming involves creating web pages, web applications, and other online content that can be
                    displayed in a web browser. Web programming is accomplished using a variety of programming languages, including
                     HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses,
                      and the choice of language depends on the needs of the project. The Internet is a vast network of computers, 
                      and servers, which communicate with each other. The Internet is a vast network that connects billions of
                       computers and other electronic devices all around the world. You can get nearly any information, communicate
                        with anyone on the globe, and do a lot more with the Internet. All of this is possible by connecting a
                         computer to the Internet, generally known as going online. When someone says a computer is online, they are
                          simply referring to the fact that it is linked to the Internet.

                The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the 
                providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server 
                architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server 
                accepts the requested process and delivers the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share 
                any of their resources. Examples of the Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        An application server is a modern form of platform middleware. It is system software that resides between the 
        operating system (OS) on one side, the external resources (such as a database management system [DBMS], 
        communications and Internet services) on another side and the users' applications on the third side.

            <h1>Web Security</h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Web security protects networks, servers, and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes defending computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Website protection technology has enabled enhanced protection mechanisms, such as the protection of a virtual private network (VPN), which also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations. Businesses need to account for the factors that go into web security and threat prevention.

                Web content is the text, visual or audio content that is made available online and user encountered as part of the online usage and experience on websites. It may include text, images, sounds and audio, online videos, among other items placed within web pages.
        
                In the book Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville wrote,
                 "We define content broadly as 'the stuff in your website.' Web content may include webpage document pages,
                  information, software data and applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages,
                   archived e-mail messages stored on email servers, and more. And we include future web content as well as
                    present web content roadmap."</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.
        
        Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use HTTPS. In modern web browsers such as Chrome, websites that do not use HTTPS are marked differently than those that are. Look for a padlock in the URL bar to signify the webpage is secure. Web browsers take HTTPS seriously; Google Chrome and other browsers flag all non-HTTPS websites as not secure.
